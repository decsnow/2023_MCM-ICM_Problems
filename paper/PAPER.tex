In today's society, the game industry is booming and more and more people are participating in the game industry. Games have become part of everyone's life.So many games are so well made and so expensive that games are now known as the Ninth art.The wordle this game, only five letters, simple game six speculation has attracted millions of people visit, hundreds of thousands of twitter to share every day.The popularity of the game has also attracted the attention of all sectors of society. The New York Times invited us to build a model to predict how the number of Wordle users changes and how word attributes influence the number of guesses and accuracy of users.At the beginning, our team thought that the first question was very simple. We used simple exponential fitting and Gaussian fitting to complete the first question to predict the number of people on March 1st, and the fitting effect was very good. The number of people predicted by the index on March 1 was 18,785, and the goodness of fit 
$R^2 = 0.9968$. 
The number of people predicted by the index on March 1 was 13,914, and the goodness of fit 
$R^2 = 0.9892$.
But we later found out that all of the data was shared by Twitter users and not by all of the players. The idea of survivor bias immediately came to mind.Immediately decided to optimize their own models.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem Background}
The New York Times wordle game was born. The simple five-letter, six-guess game rules aroused wide attention of the society. And the effect of the attributes of the word on the result of the guess got us thinking. After a cursory search, we found that there are as many as 30,000 five-letter English words, and they cover all aspects of life. The inexhaustible question bank brings new game experiences for everyone. By analyzing the attributes of a word, we can rate the words and identify their difficulty. To better predict how the public will play wordle in the future.


Two major problems are discussed in this paper, which are:
\begin{itemize}
     \item What are the attributes of a five-letter word.
    \item Complete the specific and practical word rating program and analyze the difficulty coefficient of five-letter words.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Subject:} A better choice than MS Word: \LaTeX
\end{flushleft}

In the memo, we want to introduce you an alternate typesetting program to the prevailing MS Word: \textbf{\LaTeX}. In fact, the history of \LaTeX\ is even longer than that of MS Word. In 1970s, the famous computer scientist Donald Knuth first came out with a typesetting program, which named \TeX\ \ldots

Firstly, \ldots

Secondly, \ldots

Lastly, \ldots

According to all those mentioned above, it is really worth to have a try on \LaTeX!
